Title: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Evidence-Based Medicine.
URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/39437276
Matching Sentences:
 - This study explores integrating LLMs into the key stages in EBM, evaluating their ability across evidence retrieval (PICO extraction, biomedical question answering), synthesis (summarizing randomized controlled trials), and dissemination (medical text simplification).
 - Promoting strategies such as knowledge-guided prompting proved highly effective (e.g., improving the performance of GPT-4 by 13.10% over zero-shot in PICO extraction).

Title: A span-based model for extracting overlapping PICO entities from randomized controlled trial publications.
URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38471120
Matching Sentences:
 - Extracting PICO (Populations, Interventions, Comparison, and Outcomes) entities is fundamental to evidence retrieval.
 - We present a novel method, PICOX, to extract overlapping PICO entities.
 - Then, it uses a multi-label classifier to assign one or more PICO labels to a span candidate.
 - PICOX was evaluated using 1 of the best-performing baselines, EBM-NLP, and 3 more datasets, ie, PICO-Corpus and randomized controlled trial publications on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or COVID-19, using entity-level precision, recall, and F1 scores.
 - On the PICO-Corpus, PICOX obtained higher recall and F1 scores than the baseline and improved the micro recall score from 56.66 to 67.33.

Title: Retrieval augmented scientific claim verification.
URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38455840
Matching Sentences:
 - We developed CliVER, an end-to-end scientific <b>Cl</b>a<b>i</b>m <b>VER</b>ification system that leverages retrieval-augmented techniques to automatically retrieve relevant clinical trial abstracts, extract pertinent sentences, and use the PICO framework to support or refute a scientific claim.
 - We then constructed CoVERt, a new <b>CO</b>VID <b>VER</b>ifica<b>t</b>ion dataset comprising 15 PICO-encoded drug claims accompanied by 96 manually selected and labeled clinical trial abstracts that either support or refute each claim.

Title: Translating Clinical Questions by Physicians Into Searchable Queries: Analytical Survey Study.
URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32310137
Matching Sentences:
 - Our primary objective was to examine how clinicians formulate their queries on a federated search engine, according to the population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) framework.
 - Recording account log-ins and usage, we extracted all 1085 queries performed during a 6-month period and classified each search term according to the PICO framework.

Matching Sentences:
 - We compared search results from a PICO (patients, intervention, comparison, outcome) framework for questions using different combinations of PICO elements.
 - Answers to all 6 questions using the PICO framework were found.
 - A higher number of systematic reviews were obtained using a 2 PICO element search compared to a 4 element search.
